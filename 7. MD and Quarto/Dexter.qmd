# Introduction
*Dexter* is an American television drama that was broadcast on the premium cable channel *Showtime* from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013. A total of 96 episodes of Dexter were broadcast over eight seasons.

The series is based on characters created by *Jeff Lindsay* for his "Dexter" series of novels, and follows the life of Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a Miami Metro Police Department blood pattern analyst with a double life. While investigating murders in the homicide division, Dexter hunts and kills murderers and criminals who have escaped the justice system. Although the first season is based on the events of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the series' subsequent seasons do not follow the novels in the series. Departing from the narrative of Lindsay's second Dexter novel Dearly Devoted Dexter, the show's writer Daniel Cerone said that the writers "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" to adapt it.
