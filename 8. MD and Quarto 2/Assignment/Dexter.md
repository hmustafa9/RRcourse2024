# Introduction:

*Dexter* is an American television drama that was broadcast on the
premium cable channel *Showtime* from October 1, 2006, to September 22,
2013. A total of 96 episodes of Dexter were broadcast over eight
seasons.

The series is based on characters created by *Jeff Lindsay* for his
“Dexter” series of novels, and follows the life of Dexter Morgan
(Michael C. Hall), a Miami Metro Police Department blood pattern analyst
with a double life. While investigating murders in the homicide
division, Dexter hunts and kills murderers and criminals who have
escaped the justice system. Although the first season is based on the
events of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the series’ subsequent seasons do not
follow the novels in the series. Departing from the narrative of
Lindsay’s second Dexter novel Dearly Devoted Dexter, the show’s writer
Daniel Cerone said that the writers “didn’t see the opportunity in the
second book” to adapt it.
